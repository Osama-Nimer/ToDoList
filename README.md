# To-Do List Web Application

A simple and interactive To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for managing tasks efficiently.

- User Registration & Login: Users can create accounts and log in to manage their tasks.
- Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- View Tasks: Displays tasks in a tabular format with task names, statuses (Completed/Incomplete), and actions.
- Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks, and the interface updates dynamically.
- Task Status: Displays each task's completion status, with "Incomplete" and "Completed" labels.
